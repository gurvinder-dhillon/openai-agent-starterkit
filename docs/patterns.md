# Agent Patterns

This document describes the different agent patterns available in the OpenAI Agent Starter Kit, based on Anthropic's research on building effective agents.

## Pattern Overview

Each pattern addresses different use cases and complexity levels:

1. **Augmented LLM** - Basic building block with tools and memory
2. **Sequential Agents** - Linear handoff between specialized agents (Coming Soon)
3. **Hierarchical Agents** - Manager-worker delegation (Coming Soon)
4. **Tool-calling Agents** - Specialized tool usage (Coming Soon)
5. **Collaborative Agents** - Shared context and parallel execution (Coming Soon)

## Augmented LLM Pattern

The foundational pattern that enhances a base LLM with additional capabilities.

### Key Features

- **Tool Integration**: Access to external tools and APIs
- **Memory Management**: Persistent context across conversations
- **Guardrails**: Input/output validation and safety checks
- **Structured Interactions**: Clear patterns for tool usage

### Use Cases

- Research assistants
- Document analysis
- Data processing
- General-purpose AI assistants

### Architecture

```
User Input → Input Guardrails → Agent → Tools → Output Guardrails → Response
                                   ↓
                              Memory Store
```

### Implementation

```typescript
import { Agent } from '@openai/agents';

const agent = new Agent({
  name: 'Augmented Research Assistant',
  instructions: `You are an advanced research assistant...`,
  tools: [
    webSearchTool,
    fileSystemTool,
    calculatorTool,
    memoryTool,
  ],
  guardrails: [
    inputGuardrail,
    outputGuardrail,
  ],
});
```

### Tools Included

1. **Web Search Tool**
   - Search the web for current information
   - Configurable result limits
   - Error handling for API failures

2. **File System Tool**
   - Read and write files
   - File existence checks
   - Secure path handling

3. **Calculator Tool**
   - Mathematical expression evaluation
   - Safe expression parsing
   - Error handling for invalid expressions

4. **Memory Tool**
   - Store and retrieve context
   - Session-based memory
   - Key-value storage

### Guardrails

1. **Input Validation**
   - Content filtering
   - Length limits
   - Harmful pattern detection

2. **Output Validation**
   - Sensitive information detection
   - Quality checks
   - Safety filtering

### Customization

You can customize the Augmented LLM pattern by:

- Adding new tools
- Modifying guardrails
- Adjusting agent instructions
- Extending memory capabilities

## Sequential Agents Pattern (Coming Soon)

A pattern where tasks are decomposed into sequential steps, with each step handled by a specialized agent.

### Characteristics

- Linear workflow
- Specialized agents for each step
- Clear handoff mechanisms
- Intermediate result passing

### Use Cases

- Content creation pipelines
- Data processing workflows
- Multi-step analysis tasks

## Hierarchical Agents Pattern (Coming Soon)

A pattern with a manager agent that delegates tasks to worker agents.

### Characteristics

- Central coordination
- Task decomposition
- Dynamic delegation
- Result synthesis

### Use Cases

- Complex problem solving
- Multi-domain tasks
- Parallel processing

## Tool-calling Agents Pattern (Coming Soon)

Specialized agents focused on specific tool usage patterns.

### Characteristics

- Tool-specific expertise
- Optimized tool selection
- Efficient tool usage
- Domain specialization

### Use Cases

- API integration
- Data analysis
- System automation

## Collaborative Agents Pattern (Coming Soon)

Multiple agents working together on shared tasks.

### Characteristics

- Shared context
- Parallel execution
- Consensus building
- Distributed decision making

### Use Cases

- Team collaboration
- Multi-perspective analysis
- Consensus building

## Choosing the Right Pattern

Consider these factors when selecting a pattern:

1. **Task Complexity**
   - Simple tasks: Augmented LLM
   - Multi-step tasks: Sequential Agents
   - Complex tasks: Hierarchical Agents

2. **Domain Expertise**
   - General purpose: Augmented LLM
   - Specialized tools: Tool-calling Agents
   - Multiple domains: Hierarchical Agents

3. **Collaboration Needs**
   - Single agent: Augmented LLM
   - Multiple perspectives: Collaborative Agents
   - Delegation: Hierarchical Agents

4. **Performance Requirements**
   - Low latency: Augmented LLM
   - High throughput: Collaborative Agents
   - Balanced: Sequential Agents

## Pattern Migration

As your needs evolve, you can migrate between patterns:

1. **Augmented LLM → Sequential Agents**
   - Extract specialized components
   - Add handoff mechanisms
   - Implement workflow coordination

2. **Sequential Agents → Hierarchical Agents**
   - Add manager agent
   - Implement task decomposition
   - Add result synthesis

3. **Any Pattern → Collaborative Agents**
   - Add shared context
   - Implement consensus mechanisms
   - Add parallel execution

## Best Practices

1. **Start Simple**
   - Begin with Augmented LLM
   - Add complexity only when needed
   - Measure performance impact

2. **Design for Observability**
   - Add logging and tracing
   - Monitor agent interactions
   - Track performance metrics

3. **Implement Safety**
   - Use appropriate guardrails
   - Validate all inputs/outputs
   - Handle edge cases

4. **Optimize for Maintenance**
   - Keep agents focused
   - Document behavior clearly
   - Test thoroughly
